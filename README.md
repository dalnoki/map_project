## Map of Central Park

This is the final project of the FEND Nanodegree of Udacity. The main goal was to show some interesting places on a map. My aim was to create something really retro design, that reminds me the good ol' days of internet :)

# User guide

You can see 5 interesting places on the map. You can filter the locations and if you click on the markers or on the entry in the list, you can learn more about that location.

In order to check it:
- download this repo
- go to the root of your directory and run `npm install`
- go to localhost:3000 in our browser and voil√° :)

The project uses data from the Foursquare API.

In order to work offline and to get advantage of the service worker, you'll need to run the app in production mode! In order to do so, please use `npm run build` then `serve -s build`!
